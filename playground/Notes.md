# Notes during Development

## Labeling
* ensure that the label files are in the same format as the label files from Guardian and EmpkinS (or it must be handled in the dataset implementations)  
=> TODO: adapt labeling GUI and write labeling converter
* notes for labeling:
  * no labels should be outside the heartbeat borders, i.e., the reference label files should start with a heartbeat and end with a heartbeat instead of another event
